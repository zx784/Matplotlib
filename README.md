# Data Analysis and Preprocessing Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for data analysis and preprocessing tasks using a **LEGO dataset**. The dataset consists of **over 150,000 records** and is used to explore various aspects of LEGO products. The notebook showcases data cleaning, transformation, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

# Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook serves as an introduction to data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a large LEGO dataset. It covers the following:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data and identifying patterns, trends, and outliers.
- **Data Transformation:** Scaling and transforming data to prepare it for further analysis.
- **Basic Visualizations:** Graphs and charts to help extract insights from the dataset.

The dataset contains **more than 150,000 rows**, providing a comprehensive view of LEGO products, their categories, and various attributes like price, pieces, and themes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing Techniques:** 
  - Handling missing data and inconsistencies
  - Imputing missing values and detecting outliers
  - Scaling numerical features to standardize data
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
  - Visual exploration of feature distributions, correlations, and relationships
  
- **Visualization:**
  - Bar plots, histograms, scatter plots
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
  
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Standardization of numerical columns
  - Categorical data encoding
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **scikit-learn** (for preprocessing and scaling)
- **numpy** (for numerical operations)

## You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
Running the Notebook
## Clone the repository:
Copy
git clone https://github.com/zx784/Matplotlib.git
cd Matplotlib
Open the notebook using Jupyter:

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the data_analysis_notebook.ipynb file and open it in your browser.

Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis and preprocessing.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this notebook contains more than **150,000** records related to LEGO products. The data includes information about:

**LEGO Product Information:** Names, themes, pieces, prices, and more

**Categories and Subcategories:** Different types of LEGO sets categorized by their theme, age group, and special features

**Pricing:** Prices across different LEGO sets

**Piece Count:** The number of pieces in each LEGO set

## How to Use the Notebook
Load your LEGO dataset into the notebook by replacing the data file path in the code.

Execute the preprocessing steps, including missing value handling, outlier detection, and scaling.

Explore the visualizations generated in the EDA section to gain insights into the dataset.

Apply any necessary transformations to the data and export it for further use in modeling or analysis.
